                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2005, Riverside Rapids White Water Rafting began as a small family-owned business with a mission to share the
                thrill of river adventure. Our founders, passionate outdoor enthusiasts and experienced guides, recognized the
                incredible potential of our local waterways and set out to create a safe, fun, and eco-friendly white water rafting
                experience for everyone.
                Over the years, Riverside Rapids has grown from a modest operation serving a handful of local adventurers to the leading
                provider of white water rafting services in the region. We have expanded our fleet, trained a team of experienced
                guides, and invested in the latest safety equipment to ensure every trip is both exciting and safe.
                Our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship has earned us recognition and numerous awards, helping us
                build strong relationships with local communities and conservation organizations. Today, Riverside Rapids is proud to
                serve thousands of satisfied customers each year, offering unforgettable adventures that combine adrenaline, nature, and
                safety.</p>
